# Ebook Generator

Some code to take a single block of HTML and split it into chapters in an ePub file.

Chapters are assumed to be delimited with either `<p>chapter</p>` or `<p><strong>chapter</strong></p>`.

Used for some Patreon subscriptions which do not provide an ePub file but post their content as HTML.
